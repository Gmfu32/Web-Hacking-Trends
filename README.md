# Web-Hacking-Trends
The dataset contains 212,093 records of web hacking incidents between 1998 and 2015, with 12 attributes describing each event. Columns include date that describes when the incident happened, and notify that identifies the reporting group or source. The URL column captures the website details, and the IP and Country columns provide information about the website location, but much information is missing. The OS and Web Server columns describe the server environment while the Encoding and Language column describe server configuration and the website language. The Ransom, Downtime, and Loss columns record the financial and operational impacts. The data provides rich insights but needs extensive cleaning due to having many missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies across categorical and numerical fields. However, it still provides valuable basis for analyzing the trends in web hacking and assessing the impact of cyberattacks.

Hypothesis & Objectives:

Hypothesis: The financial loss incurred due to web hacking trends is significantly influenced by the country, operating system, web server, and ransom.

Objective 1: Analyzing whether financial loss varies significantly across different countries.
Objective 2: Examining the relationship between the type of web server and the financial loss incurred during an attack.
Objective 3: Determining how the type of operating system impacts the severity of financial loss.
Objective 4: Examining the extent to which ransom demands influence
the financial loss incurred due to web hacking incidents.
